2048clone
=========

A 2048 game clone using HTML5 canvas element.
I made this purely as an exercise in vanilla JS.

It has bugs! And I may not have the time to fix them.

**Features**

  - Adjustable grid size! Need to implement this on front-end
  
  - You can carry on beyond 2048
  
**To Do**

  - Make front-end nicer
